# Consistent Versioning UI Updates

## Overview
Updated all UI components to use the clean, color-coded version display pattern across products, workflows, projects, and steps.

## Updated Components

### 1. Product Cards
**Before:**
```
Loan Platform  [v1.2.0]
[Active]
```

**After:**
```
Loan Platform
[v1.2.0] (amber - In Review)
```

### 2. Workflow Headers
**Before:**
```
Loan Application [In Review]
```

**After:**
```
Loan Application
[v1.2.0] (amber - In Review)
```

### 3. Project Information (Step Detail View)
**Before:**
```
Project: Loan Application
Status: [Develop]
Version: 1.1.0
```

**After:**
```
Project: Loan Application  
Version: [v1.1.0] (green - Active)
```

### 4. Steps
**Before:**
```
Actor â†’ Action â†’ Resource [Active]
```

**After:**
```
Actor â†’ Action â†’ Resource
```
*Steps inherit version status from their parent workflow*

## Color Coding System

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Active (currently deployed/live)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Amber**: In Review (being evaluated/tested)  
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Planned (scheduled for future development)
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Draft (work in progress, not ready)
- âš« **Gray**: Deprecated (no longer supported)

## Benefits

1. **Visual Consistency**: Same pattern across all UI components
2. **Immediate Status Recognition**: Color instantly communicates state
3. **Reduced Clutter**: No redundant status badges
4. **Better Information Hierarchy**: Version becomes the primary status indicator
5. **Cleaner Design**: Focus on what matters most - current version and state

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Get latest version from history
const latestVersion = getLatestVersion(item.versionHistory)

// Apply color based on status  
const colorClass = getVersionStatusColor(latestVersion.status)

// Display as single badge
<Badge className={colorClass}>v{latestVersion.version}</Badge>
```

## Version Inheritance

- **Products**: Have their own version history
- **Workflows**: Have their own version history within products
- **Projects**: Have their own version history within products  
- **Steps**: Inherit version status from parent workflow (no individual versioning)

This creates a clean, consistent experience where version information is the primary way to understand the current state of any component in the system.
