# Simplified Version Display

## Overview
The DNA Studio versioning system now uses a clean, single-version display with color-coded status indicators instead of showing multiple versions with text labels.

## Color-Coded Version Status

### Visual Indicators
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green**: Active version (currently deployed/live)
- **ðŸŸ¡ Amber/Orange**: In Review (being evaluated/tested)
- **ðŸ”µ Blue**: Planned (scheduled for future development)
- **ðŸŸ£ Purple**: Draft (work in progress, not ready)
- **âš« Gray**: Deprecated (no longer supported)

### Display Format
Instead of showing multiple badges like:
```
v1.1.0 Active    v1.2.0 In Review
```

We now show just the latest version with color coding:
```
v1.2.0  (in amber/orange, indicating it's "In Review")
```

## Examples

### Loan Platform
- **Current**: `v1.2.0` in amber (In Review)
- **Previous**: `v1.1.0` was green (Active), now deprecated

### Banking Core  
- **Current**: `v2.1.0` in blue (Planned)
- **Previous**: `v2.0.1` is green (Active)

### Workflow Example
- **Loan Application**: `v1.2.0` in amber (In Review)
- **Reporting & Analytics**: `v2.0.0` in amber (In Review)

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Single version badge vs multiple badges
2. **Intuitive Colors**: Status is immediately clear from color
3. **Less Clutter**: No redundant status text
4. **Focus on Latest**: Shows what matters most - the current/newest version
5. **Consistent**: Same pattern across products, workflows, and projects

## Implementation

```typescript
// Get the latest version (highest semantic version number)
const latestVersion = getLatestVersion(product.versionHistory)

// Apply color based on status
const colorClass = getVersionStatusColor(latestVersion.status)

// Display as single badge
<Badge className={colorClass}>v{latestVersion.version}</Badge>
```

## Status Transitions

Typical version lifecycle:
1. **Draft** (Purple) â†’ Work in progress
2. **In Review** (Amber) â†’ Ready for evaluation  
3. **Active** (Green) â†’ Deployed and live
4. **Deprecated** (Gray) â†’ Superseded by newer version

Planning flow:
1. **Planned** (Blue) â†’ Scheduled for future development
2. **Draft** (Purple) â†’ Development started
3. **In Review** (Amber) â†’ Ready for evaluation
4. **Active** (Green) â†’ Deployed and live

This simplified approach makes the version status immediately clear while reducing visual noise in the interface.
