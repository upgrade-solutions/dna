# DNA Codes (@dna-codes)
DNA is a description language for business systems — your digital DNA. Once defined, it can be used to generate documentation, workflows, and robust software automatically.

A DSL written in JSON/YAML, it describes a business at three intentionally decoupled layers — what the business does, what gets built, and how it gets built — and provides tooling to validate those descriptions and render them as documentation.

As documented below, it's incredibly flexible with input/output adapters and integrations, but it's particularly useful in conjunction with [cell-based architecture](https://github.com/upgrade-solutions/cell-based-architecture). Below is a visual that represents the general scope of DNA.

## The Three Layers

| Layer | What it captures | Analogous to |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Operational** | What the business does — people, structures, rules, SOPs | Domain-Driven Design |
| **Product** | What gets built — resources, operations, endpoints, pages | OpenAPI + Atomic Design |
| **Technical** | How it gets built — cells, constructs, providers, environments | Terraform / AWS SAM |

Layers are one-way downstream: Operational → Product → Technical. Upper layers never depend on lower ones. Cross-layer references (e.g. a Product Resource pointing at an Operational Resource) are plain strings validated by `@dna-codes/dna-core` rather than JSON Schema `$ref`s.

Operational DNA is **organizational modeling** — the **nouns** an organization deals with (people, places, things) and the **verbs** that bind them. It's modeled around the **Actor > Action > Subject** triad: Roles act, Subjects (any noun primitive) receive actions. Operational primitives fall into three categories — **People** (Person, Role, Group, Membership), **Structures** (Resource, Attribute, Relationship), and **Activities** (Operation, Task, Step, Process, Trigger, Rule). An **Operation** is always a `Target.Action` pair where Target is any noun primitive.

Here's a minimal Operational DNA document in a lending context:

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "name": "lending",
    "path": "acme.finance.lending",
    "resources": [
      {
        "name": "Loan",
        "attributes": [
          { "name": "amount", "type": "number", "required": true },
          { "name": "status", "type": "enum", "values": ["pending", "active", "repaid"] }
        ],
        "actions": [
          { "name": "Apply",   "type": "write" },
          { "name": "Approve", "type": "write" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "persons": [
      { "name": "Borrower" },
      { "name": "Employee" }
    ],
    "groups": [
      { "name": "BankDepartment" }
    ],
    "roles": [
      { "name": "Underwriter", "scope": "BankDepartment" }
    ]
  },
  "memberships": [
    { "name": "EmployeeUnderwriter", "person": "Employee", "role": "Underwriter" }
  ],
  "operations": [
    { "target": "Loan", "action": "Apply",   "name": "Loan.Apply",   "changes": [{ "attribute": "status", "set": "pending" }] },
    { "target": "Loan", "action": "Approve", "name": "Loan.Approve", "changes": [{ "attribute": "status", "set": "active" }] }
  ],
  "triggers": [
    { "operation": "Loan.Apply",   "source": "user" },
    { "operation": "Loan.Approve", "source": "user" }
  ],
  "rules": [
    { "operation": "Loan.Apply",   "type": "access", "allow": [{ "role": "Borrower" }] },
    { "operation": "Loan.Approve", "type": "access", "allow": [{ "role": "Underwriter" }] },
    { "operation": "Loan.Approve", "type": "condition", "conditions": [{ "attribute": "loan.status", "operator": "eq", "value": "pending" }] }
  ]
}
```

## Cross-domain examples

Canonical end-to-end DNA documents demonstrating the model across different business domains. Each one validates against the schemas under `@dna-codes/dna-core` and exercises specific parts of the model — start here when you want to see how a real domain looks.

| Example | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| [`examples/lending`](./examples/lending) | Operations, Tasks, Process; Operation-level + Process-level Triggers; system Role (scheduled job); scoped Role; Person-as-actor (Borrower) + Role-as-actor (Underwriter); Memberships |
| [`examples/mass-tort`](./examples/mass-tort) | Case as Group; multiple Person→Role Memberships (Partner→LeadCounsel/CoCounsel); multiple Processes; Process triggered by Operation completion |
| [`examples/marketplace`](./examples/marketplace) | Same Person template eligible for two peer Roles via Memberships (Member→Host AND Member→Guest); two Groups (Listing, Booking); global (unscoped) Role; Step.else routing |
| [`examples/healthcare`](./examples/healthcare) | Patient as Person template (structure + lifecycle); per-Person Role.scope (AttendingPhysician.scope = Patient); mixed scope targets (Person + Group); multi-predicate condition Rule |
| [`examples/manufacturing`](./examples/manufacturing) | Multiple system Roles (CNC, press, paint robot, scheduler) with `system: true` and `resource:` link; parallel fan-out + fan-in via Step.depends_on; schedule-source Trigger on a system Operation |
| [`examples/education`](./examples/education) | Course (Resource catalog) vs CourseOffering (Group); two Person templates eligible for distinct Roles (Faculty→Instructor, UniversityMember→Student); three scope tiers; calendar-aligned schedule Triggers |

## Framework comparisons

If you already model your domain in DDD, BPMN, ArchiMate, C4, Event Storming, or run a TOGAF practice, see [`docs/frameworks/`](./docs/frameworks) for concept-by-concept mappings, where DNA intentionally differs, and concrete translations using the examples above. Currently covered: [BPMN](./docs/frameworks/bpmn.md), [Domain-Driven Design](./docs/frameworks/ddd.md), [ArchiMate](./docs/frameworks/archimate.md), [C4 Model](./docs/frameworks/c4.md), [Event Storming](./docs/frameworks/event-storming.md), [TOGAF](./docs/frameworks/togaf.md).

## Operational Layer

Operational DNA captures organizational modeling — what an organization *is* and what it *does*, independent of UI, API, or deployment technology. Three categories of primitives:

- **People** — Person, Role, Group, Membership
- **Structures** — Resource, Attribute, Relationship
- **Activities** — Operation, Task, Step, Process, Trigger, Rule

`Domain` wraps the four noun primitives (Resources, Persons, Roles, Groups) into bounded contexts; `Memberships` and Activities live at the document top level.

**People primitives:**
- **Person** — an individual template (`Customer`, `Employee`, `Patient`, `Borrower`). The kind of human the org deals with — not a specific named individual (instance-level data lives in Product/Technical layers). Has attributes and optional actions.
- **Role** — a position/capacity template (`Underwriter`, `Doctor`, `LeadCounsel`, `SuperAdmin`). May declare `scope` (the Group or Person the Role is exercised within), optional `system: true` for non-human actors, optional `resource:` link when a system Role is backed by a Resource template, optional `actions[]` for org-admin lifecycle (e.g. `Underwriter.Activate`), and optional per-scope-instance constraints `cardinality` (`one`/`many`), `required` (presence), and `excludes` (mutual-exclusion with other Roles on the same scope instance).
- **Group** — a work-unit / container template (`BankDepartment`, `Hospital`, `Case`, `Workspace`, `Family`). Has attributes and lifecycle; primarily exists to scope Roles.
- **Membership** — a template-level eligibility statement: "Persons of type X may hold Roles of type Y, optionally in Groups of type Z." Captures organizational RBAC at the type level — *not* per-instance bindings.

**Structure primitives:**
- **Resource** — a structure template the org manages (`Loan`, `Invoice`, `Account`, `Document`). Has attributes, actions, and optional parent.
- **Attribute** — a typed property on any noun primitive; types: `string`, `text`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `enum`, `reference`.
- **Relationship** — a named, directed, typed connection between any two noun primitives (cardinality + reference attribute).

**Shared noun shape:** Resource, Person, Role, and Group all support `name`, `attributes[]`, `actions[]`, and optional `parent`. Each `actions[]` entry is an object with `name`, optional `description`, `type` (`read | write | destructive`), and `idempotent`.

**Activity primitives:**
- **Operation** — a `Target.Action` pair where Target is any noun primitive; the atomic unit of business activity (`Loan.Approve`, `Patient.GetAdmitted`, `Underwriter.Activate`, `Case.Settle`). The validator resolves `target` across all four noun collections. Optional `changes[]` declares the state mutations the Operation applies to its target Resource (the only place state-mutation modeling lives — there is no separate Outcome primitive).
- **Trigger** — what initiates an Operation or a Process. Sources: `user`, `schedule`, `webhook`, `operation`. A Trigger targets exactly one of: an Operation (ad-hoc invocation) or a Process (kick off the whole SOP from `startStep`). Operation-to-Operation chaining is expressed via `source: "operation"` + `after`.
- **Rule** — constraints on an Operation: `access` (which Roles or Persons may perform it) or `condition` (what must be true first). Condition Rules are also referenced from `Step.conditions[]` for compositional gating — the only mechanism for entry/intra-Process gating.
- **Task** — a `(actor, operation)` binding. Actor is a Role (internal positions like Underwriter) OR a Person (external actors like Borrower). The standalone equivalent of an orchestrated Step — Tasks describe SOP atoms outside any Process.
- **Process** — a Standard Operating Procedure: a named DAG of **Steps** with an explicit `startStep` (Amazon-States-Language convention). Each Step references exactly one Task and adds orchestration metadata (`depends_on`, `conditions`, `else`); Steps are inline sub-primitives of Process — they have no top-level schema and are meaningful only inside `Process.steps[]`.

**Memberships are template-level, not instances:**

```json
{ "name": "EmployeeUnderwriter", "person": "Employee", "role": "Underwriter" }
{ "name": "PartnerLeadCounsel",  "person": "Partner",  "role": "LeadCounsel" }
{ "name": "EmployeeAdmin",       "person": "Employee", "role": "SuperAdmin", "group": "Workspace" }
```

These say *what kinds of people can hold what kinds of roles in what kinds of groups* — not "Joe is the Underwriter of Eastern Branch." Specific person × role × group bindings (auth records, identity tokens) belong at the Product/Technical layer.

## Product Layer

Product DNA describes what gets built. It is split into three sub-layers that can be authored independently.

**Core** (`product.core.json`) — materializes Operational concepts into product primitives: `Resource`, `Action`, `Operation`, `Field`. Product `Resource` and `Action` are surface projections of their Operational counterparts — the same vocabulary is reused intentionally. Operational People primitives (Person, Role, Group, Membership) are referenced by product/api cells for auth middleware and product/ui cells for permission guards; how they project into Product Core is an open question (`ROADMAP.md` for details).

**API** (`product.api.json`) — REST surface: `Endpoint`, `Namespace`, `Param`, `Schema`

**UI** (`product.ui.json`) — web surface: `Layout`, `Page`, `Route`, `Block`

## Technical Layer

Technical DNA (`technical.json`) describes how the system is deployed and wired together.

Primitives: `Cell`, `Construct`, `Environment`, `Node`, `Connection`, `Zone`, `Provider`, `Variable`, `Output`, `Script`, `View`

A **Cell** is the unit of deployment — it consumes DNA from upper layers and generates concrete artifacts (API code, database migrations, infrastructure templates).

## Packages

### Pipeline

The pipeline is `[integration] → input-* → DNA → output-* → [integration]`. When more than one source contributes to a single DNA, `dna-ingest` fans many `(integration → input-* → partial DNA)` paths into one canonical DNA via `dna-core.merge()`:

```

                                                            [3]             [5]

  [1]  Reads from an external system (Jira, Drive, Notion, GitHub). Owns auth, rate limits, webhooks.
  [2]  Parses a format into DNA. Deterministic (JSON, OpenAPI, DDL) or Probabilistic and LLM-backed (prose, transcripts, images).
  [*]  dna-ingest is a thin orchestrator: URI scheme dispatches to integrations, MIME type dispatches to input adapters,
       per-source DNA chunks are merged into one via dna-core.merge() with conflict + provenance reporting.
  [3]  Canonical form. Three layers (operational -> product -> technical), validated by @dna-codes/dna-core.
  [4]  Renders DNA into a format. Pure, no I/O (markdown, Mermaid, HTML).
  [5]  Writes to an external system. Field mapping, API writes, change detection.

  The same integration-* package typically fills both reader and writer roles for its system.
  Single-source flows (no merge needed) skip dna-ingest and call input-* directly — both shapes are valid.
```

#### `Integration` contract for participating in `dna-ingest`

Every reader-side `integration-*` that wants to participate in multi-source ingest implements the `Integration` interface published from `@dna-codes/dna-ingest`:

```ts
interface Integration {
  fetch(uri: string): Promise<{
    contents: string | Buffer
    mimeType: string
    source: { uri: string; loadedAt: string /* ISO 8601 */ }
  }>
}
```

PDF/Office text extraction is the integration's responsibility — return already-normalized text or bytes, plus a sensible MIME type. The orchestrator routes by MIME glob into the matching `input-*` adapter. See [`packages/ingest/AGENTS.md`](packages/ingest/AGENTS.md) for the full guidance.

### Naming convention
- **`input-*`** — converts a format into DNA. Same input always produces same output (deterministic), unless the package requires an LLM, in which case it is probabilistic. Each probabilistic package documents its dependencies explicitly: required LLM provider, expected API keys, and non-determinism implications.
- **`output-*`** — renders DNA into a format string. No system knowledge; pure and local.
- **`integration-*`** — connects to an external system bidirectionally. Owns auth, field mapping, rate limits, and API versioning for that system. May use `input-*` or `output-*` packages internally.

Full API reference and layer-specific authoring DNA contracts live in [`@dna-codes/dna-core/docs/`](packages/core/docs/).

Packages are published as **private** to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/dna-codes/packages) under the `@dna-codes` scope. To install, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:packages` scope and an `.npmrc` that points at the registry:

```sh
echo '@dna-codes:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com' >> .npmrc
echo '//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_YOUR_PAT_HERE' >> .npmrc
npm install @dna-codes/dna-core
```

Read access is gated by the PAT; the token holder must be a collaborator on `dna-codes/dna` (or a member of an org team with read access). No JSR package is published.

### Releasing

Releases are tag-driven. From `main`, after bumping versions:

```sh
git tag v0.4.0
git push --tags
```

The push triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which builds every workspace and runs `npm publish --workspaces` against GitHub Packages using the auto-injected `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The workflow can also be re-run manually from the Actions tab via `workflow_dispatch`.

### Input coverage by layer

Each `input-*` package has an authoritative scope — OpenAPI honestly knows about APIs, not deployment; a JSON sample knows about structures, not rules. That narrowness is a feature: it keeps deterministic adapters from inventing. `input-text` is the catch-all LLM path that can reach any layer.

| Layer | Deterministic source(s) | Probabilistic source(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Operational** | `input-json` ✅ · `input-ddl` 🚧 | `input-text` ✅ | **Covered** |
| **Product Core** | `input-prisma` 💡 | `input-text` ✅ | Probabilistic only |
| **Product API** | `input-openapi` ✅ | `input-text` ✅ | **Covered** |
| **Product UI** | `input-figma` 💡 · `input-nextjs-routes` 💡 | `input-text` ✅ | Probabilistic only |
| **Technical** | `input-terraform` 💡 · `input-cdk` 💡 | `input-text` ✅ | Probabilistic only |

Probabilistic-only layers rely on LLM inference from prose; they're the weakest link in the pipeline and the highest-leverage targets for new deterministic adapters.
