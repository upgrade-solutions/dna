# Positioning

Digital DNA unifies scattered business knowledge into a single source of truth that both humans and AI agents can understand and execute. It's BizOps as Code--turning human knowledge into machine-readable operations that can be safely performed, tested, and evolved by humans and autonomous agents alike.

| **Intake — turn meetings & notes into models**    | • Manual documentation<br>• Business analysts & flowcharts<br>• Product specs in Confluence or Notion<br>• RAG pipelines<br>• Prompt chaining | 🗣️ Knowledge trapped in conversations<br>📄 Specs out of sync with implementation<br>🧠 Unstructured text<br>⚙️ Fragile prompt logic | **Business Knowledge Automation**   | Turns natural conversation into structured, machine-readable operations that both humans and AI agents can execute |
| **Modeling — define actors, actions, resources**  | • BPMN tools<br>• ERD / UML diagramming<br>• Low-code builders (Appian, Mendix)<br>• JSON rules manually defined | 🧩 Disconnected from real data<br>🧱 Hard to maintain<br>🧠 No unified schema for business logic<br>🔁 No persistent schema | **BizOps Modeling**              | Unified DNA schema that describes both logic *and* structure — readable by humans, executable by machines and AI agents with full context of permissions and boundaries |
| **Simulation — visualize and test workflows**     | • Lucidchart / Miro<br>• XState visualizers<br>• Static flow diagrams<br>• Synthetic data tests<br>• Sandbox frameworks | 🎭 Diagrams aren't dynamic<br>🧪 Can't simulate real states or rules<br>🧪 Time-consuming, not business-aware | **Operational Simulation**       | Interactive "digital twin" of your business — simulate states, permissions, and actions before deploying. Validate agent behavior within defined business policies |
| **Documentation — auto-generate specs & stories** | • Confluence / Notion<br>• Jira epics<br>• Manual spec writing | 🧾 Outdated, inconsistent docs<br>🧍‍♂️ High handoff cost | **Auto-Generated Documentation** | Live docs stay in sync with your DNA — diagrams, user stories, and specs update automatically with full lineage tracking |
| **Execution — safe automation & agent orchestration** | • Low-code platforms<br>• Hand-coded backends<br>• LangChain agents<br>• Ad hoc API calls<br>• External task runners | 🧱 Repetitive scaffolding<br>🚧 Mismatch between design and code<br>🤖 Agents lack context<br>🧨 Inconsistent side effects<br>🕳️ Hard to audit | **BizOps as Code + Agent Governance** | Generate production-ready APIs and UIs directly from business DNA. AI agents execute within defined policies with validation, state transitions, and permissions built-in |
| **Governance — versioning, rules, and access**    | • Git-based workflows<br>• Policy engines (OPA, Aserto)<br>• Manual permission management<br>• Log aggregators<br>• Custom dashboards | 🔐 Hidden logic, tribal knowledge<br>🔄 Inconsistent enforcement<br>🧾 No context for "why" decisions were made | **Operational Governance**       | Centralized control with full audit trail: roles, rules, version history, and decision lineage embedded directly in the DNA. Both human and agent actions traceable to source definitions |
