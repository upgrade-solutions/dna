# Positioning

Digital DNA unifies scattered business knowledge into a single source of truth that both humans and AI agents can understand and execute. It's BizOps as Code--turning human knowledge into machine-readable operations that can be safely performed, tested, and evolved by humans and autonomous agents alike.

| **Discover** | Capture business knowledge & model operations | Manual docs, flowcharts, Confluence/Notion, low-code builders | Knowledge trapped in meetings, specs out of sync, fragmented logic | Turns conversations into structured, machine-readable models that humans and AI can act on      |
| **Design**   | Simulate workflows, create designs & docs              | Lucidchart, XState visualizers, Figma, manual docs                   | Static diagrams, time-consuming validation, outdated docs          | Build a living “digital twin” of your business — test workflows and generate docs automatically |
| **Develop**  | Build applications                       | Traditional coding, Low-code platforms, spec-driven development          | Repetitive scaffolding, code buries logic, agents lack context  | Generate production-ready applications from DNA; AI agents act safely within defined rules           |
| **Deliver**  | Deploy, release, and govern workflows with access control, versioning, and auditability             | CI/CD pipelines, manual releases, policy engines, Git workflows | Service fragmentation, poor traceability & auditability           | Safely release workflows and applications from DNA with built-in governance, versioning, service maps, and audit trails    |
