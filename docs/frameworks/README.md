# Framework comparisons

DNA is a description language, not a methodology. Most teams that adopt DNA already model their domains in something — DDD, BPMN, ArchiMate, ER diagrams — and want to know how the vocabulary maps. These docs give concept-by-concept tables, list where DNA intentionally differs, and walk through one concrete translation per framework.

| Framework | When you'd reach for it | DNA mapping |
|---|---|---|
| [BPMN 2.0](./bpmn.md) | Workflow modeling — graphical process notation | DNA's `Process` / `Step` / `Task` cover the same ground textually; intentionally drops boundary events, inclusive gateways, and inline sub-processes |
| [Domain-Driven Design](./ddd.md) | Tactical + strategic domain modeling in code | Closest in spirit; Bounded Context = `Domain`, Aggregate Root = `Resource`, Domain Event = `Signal`, Specification = condition `Rule` |
| [ArchiMate 3](./archimate.md) | Enterprise architecture across business, application, and technology layers | Business layer ≈ Operational; Application ≈ Product; Technology ≈ Technical. Motivation/strategy stay out of scope |
| [C4 Model](./c4.md) | Software-architecture diagrams (Context / Container / Component / Code) | Context ≈ Operational `Domain`; Container ≈ Technical `Cell`; Component is implicit; Code is generated. Strongest at the Product/Technical boundary |
| [Event Storming](./event-storming.md) | Workshop output → DNA translation | Sticky-color → primitive mapping. Aggregate (tan) = `Resource`; Command (blue) = `Operation`; Event (orange) = `Signal`; Policy (purple) = `Trigger`; Actor (yellow) = `Resource`-as-Role |

## How to read each comparison

Every doc follows the same structure:

1. **Concept-by-concept mapping table** — every primitive in the source framework, with its DNA equivalent and a note on the translation.
2. **Where DNA intentionally differs** — features the source framework has that DNA omits on purpose, with the reasoning.
3. **Concrete translation example** — a small model in the source framework, then the same model in DNA, usually pointing at one of the [`examples/`](../../examples/) directories.
4. **See also** — cross-links to the other framework comparisons.

## Coverage status

These comparisons are starting points, not exhaustive treatments. Each is meant to be specific enough that someone fluent in the source framework can sanity-check the mapping by inspection. If you find a primitive that's missing or a translation you'd disagree with, open an issue or PR — these docs evolve with the model.

**Deferred:**

- TOGAF — process/governance overlay; too broad to map cleanly without a defined sub-scope
- ER / IDEF1X — straightforward Resource/Attribute/Relationship mapping; trivial enough to defer

If you'd find one of these useful, open an issue or PR — defer means "not yet motivated by a real need," not "won't ever do."

## When framework comparison stops being useful

DNA is meant to be readable on its own. If you find yourself reaching for the comparison docs to write basic DNA, it's a sign the README and the Operational layer docs need to be clearer — not that you need a translation table. The comparisons are for cross-team communication ("here's how this concept you already know maps") and for evaluation ("is DNA expressive enough for what we already model"), not as a primary learning resource.
